# FizzBuzz using Logistic Regression
FizzBuzz is a very simple programming task, used in software developer job interviews. In this project, we build a logistic regression model to solve the above problem using the machine learning tool in Python: scikit-learn.  We model the FizzBuzz problem as a Multiclass classification, where the classifier can be used to predict multiple outcomes.  We propose a binary representation based on the primes factors.

Through Flask (web application framework written in Python), we deploy our own machine learning model to be available for the end-users so that they can make use of it.
## Project Structure
This project has four modules **.py** :

 1. **server** - It contains the Flask APIs code that receives the number or range of numbers, computes the class label based on our model, and returns it.
 2. **fizzBuzzDataPrep** - Contains the code to generate sample data set to train the model. This module uses number encoding based on the prime factors.
 3. **fizzBuzzLogReg** - Contains the code to train and evaluate the machine learning model based on logistic regression. It include the k-Fold Cross-Validation to evaluate our machine learning model. 
 4. **usefulMethods** - It implements several useful methods to save, load the model and encode the number with the defined representation.

## Requirements
You need install the following packages to run this project just type and execute

 - **Python 3.6+**
 - **NumPy**  `(pip install numpy)`
 - **Pandas** `(pip install pandas`)
 -  **Scikit-learn** `(pip install scikit-learn) `
 - **Flask** `(pip install flask`)
 - **Joblib** `(pip install joblib`)
 

## Running the project

 1. Ensure that you are in the project home directory: **fizzBuzzML**. Run the project using below command from command prompt to start Flask API

        python server.py
        
![server.py](https://photos.google.com/search/_tra_/photo/AF1QipN0LauI3Vi5LfnK1zJrkEOTfAvw7vukpeGLDqsV)

By default, flask will run on port 5000. 

Worth noting that when run the project, the ground truth (correct) target values of the first 100 numbers is created (**"fist100FizzBuzz_ground_truth.csv"**) to the evaluate the classifiers.

 2. Navigate to URL **http://127.0.0.1:5000**

On hitting the URL from your browser you should be able to view the homepage with the names of the routes to use. 

In the first project run, we must execute the routes in this order to create the files for the machine learning model.  The data samples files are **.csv** files, the classifiers are **.pkl** files.

We should create the sample data set (route **"/generate"**). Then train/evaluate the model (route **"/train"**) and finally classify (route **/predict** ) the numbers in the range [1-100].

## Some observations

 > With the aim to train the model, we suggest the size of sample data set (generated by route **"/generate"** ) equals or more than 100 numbers.
